# About me


I have 12+ years of professional experience. After completing my Master’s degree in the UK in 2013, I returned to China and started my career as a full-stack engineer.

Over the years, around 70% of my work has been related to the WeChat ecosystem — including WeChat HTML5 Web Apps and WeChat Mini-Programs — and I’ve been involved not only in development, but also in system design, engineering practices, and product flow design for real business scenarios such as login, payments, sharing, and QR-code-based offline entry points.

I started working on WeChat-related projects in 2015 (WeChat HTML5 Web Apps), and began building WeChat Mini-Programs in 2017 when the platform first launched half years later.

Most of my experience is in consumer-facing (To-C) products. I’ve worked in both local Chinese companies and multinational environments, and I have experience collaborating with multiple teams across different countries and time zones. I’m comfortable working in cross-cultural settings and clearly communicating China- and WeChat-specific context to global stakeholders.

## Cross-platform Tech for WeChat Ecosystem

Global teams used React, while WeChat Mini Programs required a different ecosystem.  
I introduced a cross-platform approach to reuse global React experience for China Mini Programs, improving efficiency and alignment between global and local teams.

## Highlight WeChat-related Apps I Hacked (2016-2026)
