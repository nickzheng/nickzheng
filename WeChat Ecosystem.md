# About me








I have 12+ years of professional experience. After completing my Master’s degree in the UK in 2013, I returned to China and started my career as a full-stack engineer.

Over the years, around 70% of my work has been related to the WeChat ecosystem — including WeChat H5 (WebView) and WeChat Mini Programs — and I’ve been involved not only in development, but also in system design, engineering practices, and product flow design for real business scenarios such as login, payments, sharing, and QR-code-based offline entry points.

I started working on WeChat-related projects in 2014, and began building Mini Programs in 2016 when the platform first launched. Most of my experience is in consumer-facing (To-C) products. I’ve also worked in both local Chinese companies and multinational environments, so I’m comfortable collaborating across cultures and communicating China/WeChat-specific context clearly.

Familiarity with Chinese F&B industry and restaurant operations


需要人主动 ， 快速解决问题

关键协作准则：将 “清晰沟通” 和 “详尽文档” 置于核心地位，甚至用 “融入血液” 强调其重要性，本质是通过标准化信息传递，弥补远程办公中面对面交流的不足，确保协作效率。
团队能力与期待：要求团队主动从复杂信息中提炼有效 “信号”（即关键信息），以实现持续学习和调整；同时强调成员需主动跟进问题、同步进展，保障全员信息同步，避免因远程导致的信息差。

I’m not only familiar with WeChat Mini Programs technically, 
but I’ve built end-to-end WeChat ecosystem solutions for real business scenarios—especially restaurant and offline-to-online flows like login, booking, payment, QR codes, notifications, and growth. I understand both how users behave inside WeChat and how to design reliable systems behind it.
