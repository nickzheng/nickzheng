I have 12+ years of professional experience. After completing my Master’s degree in the UK in 2013, I returned to China and started my career as a full-stack engineer.

Over the years, around 70% of my work has focused on the WeChat ecosystem — including WeChat HTML5 Web Apps and WeChat Mini Programs. My involvement goes beyond development and includes system design, engineering practices, and product flow design for real-world business scenarios.

I started working on WeChat-related projects in 2015 with WeChat HTML5 Web Apps, and began building WeChat Mini Programs in 2017 when the platform officially launched.

Most of my experience is in consumer-facing (To-C) products. I’ve worked in both local Chinese companies and multinational environments, collaborating with multiple teams across different countries and time zones. I’m comfortable working in cross-cultural settings and clearly communicating China- and WeChat-specific context to global stakeholders.

## Cross-Platform Tech for the China Ecosystem
